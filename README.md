## Introduction

Brokust is a distributed message broker implemented in Rust. Inspired by Kafka, it aims to provide a high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

## Features

- **Broker Management**: Create and manage topics, publish and consume messages.
- **Segment Storage**: Efficient storage management using segments.
- **Partition Management**: Distribute load across multiple partitions.
- **ZooKeeper-like Coordination**: Manage cluster state and configurations.

### Installation

To install Brokust, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brokust.git
cd brokust
cargo build --release
```

### Broker
The broker is the central component responsible for managing topics, partitions, and handling client requests.

### Segments
Segments are used for efficient storage management. Messages are appended to segments, and segments are rolled over based on size or time policies.

### Partitions
Topics are divided into partitions to allow parallel processing. Each partition can be hosted on a different broker node, providing scalability and fault tolerance.

### ZooKeeper-like Coordination
Brokust uses a coordination mechanism similar to ZooKeeper for managing the cluster state, leader election, and configuration management.
